Gemeente `r df.top20.plus.unknown$gm_naam[i]`
-----------------
The table shows the speed test analysis for gemeente `r df.top20.plus.unknown$gm_naam[i]`. For this test the confidence level is set to `r 100*conflevel`%.

``` {r echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, results='asis'}

# create temp df
# filter specific gemeente
df.tmp <- subset(df.4G.plus.hotspots,gm_naam == df.top20.plus.unknown$gm_naam[i])

# do test result use sourced function
df.tr.dwnload.g <- fn.ttest(df.tmp,"download_kbps",conflevel)
df.tr.upload.g <- fn.ttest(df.tmp,"upload_kbps",conflevel)
df.tr.latency.g <- fn.ttest(df.tmp,"latency",conflevel)

# print test result 
print(xtable(df.tr.dwnload.g,format = "pandoc" ,  caption = "Comparison of means for metric: download(kbps)",row.names=FALSE, booktabs=TRUE), size="\\footnotesize",include.rownames=FALSE,comment=FALSE)
print(xtable(df.tr.upload.g,format = "pandoc" ,  caption = "Comparison of means for metric: upload(kbps)",row.names=FALSE), size="\\footnotesize",include.rownames=FALSE,comment=FALSE)
print(xtable(df.tr.latency.g,format = "pandoc",  caption = "Comparison of means for metric: latency(ms)",row.names=FALSE), size="\\footnotesize",include.rownames=FALSE,comment=FALSE)

Please note the column [Sign.] or "Significant", if this column states "No" the test is not significant at the `r 100*conflevel`% confidence level. This means there is no significant difference in means observed so the NULL Hypothesis can not be rejected. In layman's terms: You *cannot* conclude that one operator has a faster 4G network then the other on that particular 4G network speed measurement (download speed,  upload speed or latency).

**Explanation of terms**

\footnotesize
**Sample 1**: Number of speedtest samples for operator 1.

**Sample 2**: Number of speedtest samples for operator 2.

**Mean 1**: Average speed of speedtests for operator 1 in KBps. A high number here means that this operator has a fast download(or upload) speed. For the latency a high number means you have to wait longer to contact webpages or servers.

**Mean 2**: Average speed of speedtests for operator 2 in KBps. A high number here means that this operator has a fast download(or upload) speed. For the latency a high number means you have to wait longer to contact webpages or servers.

**P-value**: The test statistic, for more explanation see the paragraph P-Value above

**Sign.**: Short for Significance. We compare the test statistic with the predefined confidence level(`r conflevel`). 'Yes' means the test is significant, 'No' means the test is not significant."))

**Diff(in Kbps or ms)**: Difference of the means (DoM) is the difference of Mean 1 and Mean 2(Mean 1 - Mean 2). For download and upload speeds(Kbps) big positive number here means operator 1 has a faster speed then operator 2. A big negative number means that operator 2 has a faster speed then operator 1. For latency(ms) this is the opposite, because smaller is better.

**Conf Int**: Confidence interval consist of a range of values (interval) that act as good estimate of the *true* difference of the mean. We are `r 100*conflevel`% confident that the true value of the difference of the mean is in our confidence interval.

**Rel(%)**: Relative difference in percentage. It is calculated as the difference of the mean divided by the slower of the two operators average speed. If the difference is not significant (colums Sign is No), this column will state NA (not applicable). The comparison rules are similar to what is explained in the Diff(in Kbps or ms).
